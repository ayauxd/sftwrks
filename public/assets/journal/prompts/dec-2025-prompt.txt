CONCEPT - "Foundation Built":
A calendar page curling/turning from 2025 to 2026 in the upper portion of the frame.

The foundation wasn't there before - now it's permanent bedrock.
Foundation glows with subtle cyan network connections.
Paper-cut layers: calendar page in front, foundation below/behind.
