Title: The Talent War You Can't Win

Prompt:
Create a sophisticated, minimal illustration in a premium paper-cut diorama style.
STYLE: Paper-cut layered effect with visible depth. Color palette: Deep navy (#0A1628), Steel blue (#1E3A5F), Cyan glow (#00D4FF). Cinematic noir lighting. Abstract and symbolic. NO text, NO realistic faces. Professional mood.

CONCEPT - "Many Paths, One Destination":
A central glowing destination/goal orb at the top of frame.
Multiple paths lead to it: one golden/prominent highway (expensive talent route) and several alternative winding paths (upskilling routes).
All paths converge on the same destination.
A small figure silhouette on one of the alternative paths, succeeding.
Visual metaphor: multiple ways to build AI capability, not just expensive hiring.
