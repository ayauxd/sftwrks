Title: Compliance Begins, Adoption Accelerates

Prompt:
Create a sophisticated, minimal illustration in a premium paper-cut diorama style.
STYLE: Paper-cut layered effect with visible depth. Color palette: Deep navy (#0A1628), Steel blue (#1E3A5F), Cyan glow (#00D4FF). Cinematic noir lighting. Abstract and symbolic. NO text, NO realistic faces. Professional mood.

CONCEPT - "The Supportive Trellis":
A geometric scaffold/trellis structure made of clean lines, with stylized plants growing upward through it.
The scaffold provides structure but doesn't constrain - the plants reach toward a glowing light above.
The scaffold connection points glow subtle cyan.
Plants are organic shapes within the geometric framework.
Paper-cut layers create depth.
Visual metaphor: regulation as supportive framework, enabling growth rather than blocking it.
4:3 aspect ratio.
