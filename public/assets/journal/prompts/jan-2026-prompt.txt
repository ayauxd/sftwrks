Title: When Your Payment Processor Forgets You Exist

Prompt:

Minimal paper-cut illustration style.
Colors: Navy (#0A1628) background, steel blue (#1E3A5F) mid-tones, cyan (#00D4FF) glow accents.
4:3 aspect ratio.
No text. No realistic human faces. No cluttered compositions.
Clean, simple, one clear focal point.

A narrow bridge connecting two islands/platforms, but the middle section is dissolving/pixelating.
A small figure stranded on one side watches the bridge crumble.
The stable parts glow steady, the dissolving parts flicker.
Visual metaphor: platform dependency risk, connections can fail unexpectedly.
