Title: The Solo Founder Revolution

Prompt:
Create a sophisticated, minimal illustration in a premium paper-cut diorama style.
STYLE: Paper-cut layered effect with visible depth. Color palette: Deep navy (#0A1628), Steel blue (#1E3A5F), Cyan glow (#00D4FF). Cinematic noir lighting. Abstract and symbolic. NO text, NO realistic faces. Professional mood.

CONCEPT - "One Person Orchestra":
A single small human silhouette in the center of the frame.
Multiple glowing tool extensions/mechanical arms radiate outward from them.
Each tool represents a different capability (code, design, analysis, communication).
The tools glow cyan, dramatically extending the person's reach and capability.
Like a one-person orchestra with AI instruments.
Visual metaphor: solo founders amplified exponentially by AI tools.
