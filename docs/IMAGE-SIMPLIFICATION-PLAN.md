# Professional Image Simplification Plan
## Approach: Visual Storytelling for Business Audiences

---

## Design Philosophy

**Current Problem:** Images are too abstract, relying on generic noir aesthetics without clear connection to article content.

**Solution:** Each image should tell a micro-story that a viewer can understand in 2 seconds without reading the article title.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. One Concept Per Image
- **Bad:** Abstract geometric shapes floating in space
- **Good:** A single, clear visual metaphor (bridge breaking, clock ticking, funnel sorting)

### 2. Recognizable Objects First
- Start with something familiar (building, clock, bridge, shield, path)
- Add the "twist" that makes it specific to the topic
- Viewer thinks: "Oh, it's a [familiar thing] but [interesting twist]"

### 3. Human Scale Reference
- Include a small silhouette figure when possible
- Creates emotional connection and sense of scale
- Viewer can imagine themselves in the scene

### 4. Clear Visual Hierarchy
- One dominant element (60% attention)
- One supporting element (30% attention)
- Subtle background texture (10% attention)

---

## Simplified Prompt Template

```
Create a minimal illustration in paper-cut style.

SCENE: [One sentence describing what viewer sees]
FOCAL POINT: [The single most important element]
MOOD: [One word - hopeful/cautious/triumphant/curious]
PALETTE: Navy (#0A1628), Steel blue (#1E3A5F), Cyan accent (#00D4FF)

4:3 aspect ratio. No text. No realistic faces.
```

## Revised Image Concepts

### Case Studies

| Article | Current Problem | Simplified Concept |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Logistics** | Too abstract | A paper mountain of documents → funnel → organized stack. Simple. |
| **Financial AI** | Generic | Two speech bubbles: one with checkmark, one fact-checking the other. |
| **Healthcare Records** | Complex graph | Patient file folder with glowing connections to other folders. |
| **Accounting Content** | Busy pipeline | Microphone on left → video screens on right. Direct transformation. |
| **Photo Booth** | Too whimsical | Child silhouette stepping through glowing frame, emerging different. |

### Monthly Updates

| Month | Current Problem | Simplified Concept |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Jan 2026 (Stripe)** | Good | Keep: Bridge dissolving between business and cloud platform. |
| **Dec 2025** | New | Calendar page turning from 2025→2026 with AI nodes growing. |
| **Nov 2025** | Generic models | Three spotlights converging on same stage. |
| **Latency Tax** | Too complex | Two clocks: one ornate but slow, one simple but fast. |
| **Context Window** | Abstract | Long scroll with bright ends, dark middle. Spotlight searching. |
| **Chief AI Officer** | Org chart complex | Fading "AI Dept" box with tendrils flowing to all other boxes. |

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Write the One-Sentence Story
Before generating any image, write: "A viewer will see [X] and understand [Y]."

Example:
- **Logistics:** "A viewer will see a paper mountain becoming organized and understand that chaos becomes order."
- **Stripe Incident:** "A viewer will see a bridge breaking and understand that connections to platforms can fail."

### Step 2: Identify the Focal Object
Pick ONE recognizable object:
- Bridge, clock, shield, funnel, path, door, light, shadow, scale, chain, lock, key

### Step 3: Add the Twist
What makes this specific to the article?
- Bridge → but it's dissolving (platform risk)
- Clock → but it's competing with a faster clock (latency)
- Shield → but it's protecting internal systems (governance)

### Step 4: Generate with Minimal Prompt
Keep prompts under 100 words. More words = more confusion for the AI.

## Quality Checklist

Before accepting any generated image:

- [ ] Can I describe what's happening in one sentence?
- [ ] Is there a clear focal point?
- [ ] Would someone unfamiliar with the topic get the gist?
- [ ] Does it work at thumbnail size (200px)?
- [ ] Is there enough contrast between elements?
- [ ] Are the brand colors present (#0A1628, #1E3A5F, #00D4FF)?

## Example Simplified Prompts

### Logistics Case Study
```
Minimal paper-cut illustration.
A towering stack of scattered documents on the left flows through a glowing funnel, emerging as a neat organized pile on the right. A small figure oversees the process.
Navy background, cyan glow on the funnel.
4:3 ratio. No text.
```

### Latency Tax Article
```
Minimal paper-cut illustration.
Two clocks side by side. Left clock is large and ornate but hands barely move. Right clock is simple but hands spin fast with motion lines.
A waiting figure by the slow clock, a moving figure by the fast clock.
Navy background, cyan glow on the fast clock.
4:3 ratio. No text.
```

### Context Window Article
```
Minimal paper-cut illustration.
A long horizontal scroll or document. The beginning glows brightly. The end glows brightly. The middle section is dark and faded - information lost.
A small spotlight searches the dark middle but finds nothing.
Navy background, cyan accents on the bright sections.
4:3 ratio. No text.
```

## Next Steps

1. **Priority regeneration:** Case studies (most viewed)
2. **Test at thumbnail size** before full approval
3. **Create reusable prompt library** for future articles
4. **Establish visual consistency** - same figure style, same glow treatment
