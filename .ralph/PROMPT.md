# Ralph Iteration

Read these files first:
1. .ralph/PRD.md - Your task and success criteria
2. .ralph/progress.md - What's already done
3. .ralph/errors.log - What to avoid

## Your Mission
1. Pick ONE unchecked item from PRD.md
2. Complete it fully
3. Update progress.md with what you did
4. Check off the completed item in PRD.md
5. Commit your changes with a clear message
6. Exit when done

## Critical Rules
- ONE task per iteration (fresh context pattern)
- Update files before exiting (files = memory)
- If blocked, add to errors.log and pick different task
- Exit cleanly so next iteration can start fresh

- Working directory: /Users/fredpro/sftwrks
- Stack: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind v4
